            <p>Well, It was good experience for me to learn Web Development with lots of ups and downs.It was quite fun when the results appeared while doing this development process but at the same time it was challenging task in many aspects and was hectic task from my personal experience.It became quite challenging for me when i tried to make it responsive as well as while making the hamburger icon. When I encountered some problems i took reference to many sites on the Internet which helped me a lot. Learnig this module was quite fun and building your own portfolio website gives to immense joy which i felt personally.It was quite challenging but still was great journey so far from not having the basic idea of HTML to knowing at certain extent.It was irritating as well for some time when using one css property used to ruin other components in the page which gives you frustation at some time after taking a few minutes break it made me feel easy.I felt difficulties while using the git initally once i got used to it it became a lot easier for me to use and i got to learnt a lot about web development and which tags to use for the web development.I felt that you need dedication and hardwork with regular practice in this field for better results in this particular field which worked actually in my case.Debugging the code took a while for me the learn and i did it by commenting the certain part of the code and by running the other parts of the code <br>
                Here I have used pseudo property of CSS in body tag to ensure that it creates a full screen background image effect with a fixed position and desired effect and I have used animation in the homepage with blink effect.I used Sans-Serif font which made it look attractive and for the containers out there in the webpage i have made the background transparent which made it look good.
